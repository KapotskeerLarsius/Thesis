This repository contains the script to calculate volume and surface area with the RealSense camera and from saved measurements.
Realsense_aligned_frames is for aligning and obtaining the frames from the RealSense camera.
The utils scripts contain some utility functions that are used in more than one script.
Scripts with Surface_area calculate surface area with the RealSense camera or from a folder with saved measurements.
Scripts with Volume_reference_points_ calculate volume with the RealSense camera or from a folder with saved measurements.
The Volume_Reconstruction_system_Open3d folder contains the point clouds that were used for the results.

Because github does not allow for big files, for surface area only one frame was used. Because of this the results are different in the report.
I made some small adjustments for in the Volume_reference_points_from_folder.py and therefore the results are also a bit different than in the report.
